This repository contains all of the homework I did during my M.S in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington from 2024-2025.

The file called 'Bayseian-Optimization-Presentation.pdf' is a presentation I helped give during an instance of the Machine Learning Journal Club in 2025 organized by Professor Bamdad Hosseni from the Applied Mathematics department.
