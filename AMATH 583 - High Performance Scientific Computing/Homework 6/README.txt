Hi,

The necessary items are contained in each of the respective folders.

Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- utils.hpp is a file I wrote that contains helper functions for testing. 
- timer.hpp is a wrapper function to make timing my code easier.
- The written work for Problem 1 is in the PDF file in the Problem 1 folder.

Thanks again,
Nate
