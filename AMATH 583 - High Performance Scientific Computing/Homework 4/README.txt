Hi,

The necessary items are contained in each of the folders. 

- Problem 1
- Problem 2
- Problem 3
- Problem 4
- Problem 5
- Problem 6

Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- I used homework4.jpy for plotting things in Python.
- For Problem 1, I wrote code to show the action of A onto the unit balls. I included .png files of the plots and my code.
- For Problem 4, there is a PDF of my written work.
- utils.hpp is a file I wrote that contains helper functions. 

Thanks again,
Nate
