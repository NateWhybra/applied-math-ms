Hi,

The necessary items are contained in each of the respective folders.

Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------
- utils.hpp is a file I wrote that contains helper functions for testing. 
- timer.hpp is a wrapper function to make timing my code easier.
- After Problem 2 I got tired of using utils.hpp and timer.hpp and stopped using them.

Thanks again,
Nate
